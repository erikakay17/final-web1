        <h1 class="main-headline">What is rhythm?</h1>
        <p class="main-p">Rhythm is how music interacts with time. Is it fast or slow? Does
			it have a simple pattern like a heartbeat, or a more complicated rhythm like someone
			playing a drum set or a beat track for a rap song? Are the sounds long or short, or a 
			pattern that includes both? Every instrument uses
			rhythm but some instruments are specifically focused on rhythm.

		<h3 class="column-heading">Rap Beats</h3>
		<p class="column-text">Making a rap song starts with a beat track. The beat track
			is mostly rhythm (it has some pitch in it too). The performer raps over the beat
			track, and the rhythm in their rap will fit really intricately with the rhythm
			in the beat track.

		<h3 class="column-heading">Drum Rhythms</h3>
		<p class="column-text">Drummers learn a bunch of different standard drum rhythms, then 
			put them together to make the drum set sound. They'll add their own variations too. This
			video shows some of the most common rhythms drummers use.
