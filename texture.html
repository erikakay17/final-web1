        <h2>Curious about music?</h2>
        <p>We all have preferences. Our individual taste in music is really unique to each of us.
            Have you ever thought about what makes you like something, or what keeps you
            from enjoying something else? Think about a sound you like, and consider these
            three questions.</p>
    </main>

	<div id="column1">
		<h3 class="column-heading">What makes the sound?</h3>
		<p class="column-text">Texture is the way different
			sounds are layered on top of
			each other. It's what tells you
			immediately that you're hearing
			EDM, or jazz, or any
			other genre.</p>
	</div>


	<div id="column2">
		<h3 class="column-heading">How does it make you move?</h3>
		<p class="column-text">Rhythm is the pattern of repeated
			sounds. How fast is the
			repetition? How many sounds
			are in each group of sounds?
			This is the element of music that
			makes us dance -- or not.</p>
	</div>

	<div id="column3">
		<h3 class="column-heading">Is it low, high, or in between?</h3>
		<p class="column-text">Pitch is the character of the
			sounds we hear that make us say
			it's high or low or something in
			between. Pitches are grouped
			together to make chords.</p>
	</div>
