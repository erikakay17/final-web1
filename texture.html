        <h1 class="main-headline">Texture and how it's made</h1>
        <p class="main-p">Texture is the way different
			sounds are layered on top of
			each other. It's what tells you
			immediately that you're hearing
			EDM, or jazz, or any
			other genre. Most textures have a balance
            of different <strong>timbres</strong>, or types of sounds.
            Below are some examples of common textures,
            and the timbres that create them.</p>
    </main>

	<div id="column1">
		<h3 class="column-heading">The Beatles</h3>
		<p class="column-text">A drum set, with different kinds of drums,
            plus some cymbals, creates a texture all by itself. The drummer
            plays patterns that give us a strong idea of how fast the music
            goes. It's the sound we dance to. Then there are low guitars (bass
            guitars) and higher guitars. The guitars use pitches to make
            phrases of music that give us a feeling of whether the song is
            fun, serious, relaxed, joyful, etc. Then the singers add their
            own pitches, plus language.

        <h4 class="other-examples">Who else uses this texture?</h4>
        <p class="column-text">BTS, The Supremes, Taylor Swift, Lizzo, Dua Lipa</p>
	</div>


	<div id="column2">
		<h3 class="column-heading">Skrillex</h3>
		<p class="column-text">This music is called EDM (electronic dance music)
            because all of the sounds are electronic. A studio musician played every 
            note on an instrument to make a <strong>sample library</strong> and then 
            those samples were made into tracks that arrange them in certain patterns.
            When Skrillex performs, he uses different types of tracks to create the sound 
            you hear. There's always a beat, or a track that has repetitive sounds 
            that you'll want to dance to. Then there's a buildup or breakdown, that uses 
            different pitches and timbres to build excitement. The most intense set of sounds 
            is the drop, and there will be tons of tracks overlapping when the drop happens. 
            It's kind of like the high point of the song, and there can be lots of drops.</p>

		<h3 class="column-heading">Movie Music</h3>
		<p class="column-text">Pitch is the character of the
			sounds we hear that make us say
			it's high or low or something in
			between. Pitches are grouped
			together to make chords.</p>
