        <h1 class="main-headline">What are pitches?</h1>
        <p class="main-p">Pitches are the high and low sounds of music, and
			and every other sound in between high and low. In Western music the pitches (also called notes)
			are named with letters. The pitches work together to make keys, chords, and melodies.

		<h3 class="column-heading">Keys</h3>
		<p class="column-text">A key is a group of pitches that can be used in a song. 
			For example, the key of C uses C, E, F, G, A, and B. If you just play those notes
			in order, it's called a scale. The video below explains more
			about keys.

	<div id="column2">
		<h3 class="column-heading">Chords</h3>
		<p class="column-text">A chord is a group of pitches that you hear at the same time. 
			When guitar players strum, the strings are making different pitches that fit together
			to make a chord. Piano players also create chords by pressing more than one key at 
			the same time. A song will have lots of different chords, arranged in a sequence called
			a chord progression.

	<div id="column3">
		<h3 class="column-heading">Melody</h3> 
		<p class="column-text">A melody (sometimes called tune) is the part of a song that you sing along to. A lot of times someone
			sings the melody. Other times, an instrument plays the melody. The melody uses the pitches in
			the key, it complements the chords, and it also uses rhythms.
